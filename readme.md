# ChatGPT experiments

We focus on different experiments with the ChatGPT model. We will add more exciting experiments in the future.


## Experiments
# 1. Uniform number guessing
In this experiment we try to see if ChatGPT actually holds any internal state or memory
that can be used later to confirm random guess from the user.



# 2. Splitting the space of guesses
In this experiment we try to see if the choice of splitting the space of guesses
to four parts changes the guess



## Install
Run the following command to install the dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
You need to create an account on OpenAI website and get a API key and save it to api_key file.
Also, you need to create a user for chatgpt_wrapper. Take a look at [this](https://github.com/mmabrouk/chatgpt-wrapper#initial-user-creation-and-login)
